🏏 Cricket Commentary Generator using LSTM

📌 Project Overview

The Cricket Commentary Generator is a Neural Language Model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system learns patterns from real cricket match commentary and generates realistic cricket commentary automatically based on a user-provided input prompt.

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated text generation in the sports domain.
